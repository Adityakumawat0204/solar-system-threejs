3D Solar System Simulation with Three.js

A visually dynamic, mobile-responsive 3D Solar System simulation built using Three.js This project showcases realistic orbital mechanics, custom textures, lighting, interactive controls, and extra features like Saturn's rings, tooltips, and theme toggling.

**Features**
- Sun positioned at ellipse focus with realistic lighting
- All 8 planets with texture mapping and elliptical orbits
- Saturn rings rendered using a ring geometry with texture
- Pause/Resume animation
- Individual speed control sliders for each planet
- Star field background using points geometry
- Orbit controls and mouse-based tooltips
- Dark/Light theme toggle
- Mobile responsive layout
